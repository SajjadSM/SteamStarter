# SteamStarter
SteamStarter is a shell script that starts Steam at the given time to download games you previously added to the download queue. And also it can turn off your computer at a given time.

# Usage
- First download `SteamStart.ps1` file.
- Edit the first line of the `SteamStart.ps1` file and replace it with the path of the Steam exe file on your computer.
- Open `PowerShell` and navigate to the location where you downloaded the shell script type `SteamStart.ps1` and press enter.
- If your specified Steam exe file is correct you see this on the terminal: `Start download at: (default: 01:00):`
- Enter your desired time in this format: `HH:mm` (e.g. 23:15)
- Then you asked if you want to turn off your computer at a given time, type `y` for yes and `n` for no and press enter. If you said yes, enter your desired time just like the start time.

After these few steps, all is set, and remember that **don't close PowerShell**.
